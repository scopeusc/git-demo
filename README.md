> Git is so cool!  
> Complete this little quirky git challenge to learn git by example! 🤟🧠

   

### steps to complete

1. clone the repository 😊
2. checkout to a new branch 😒
3. make sure it's up to date (git pull)
4. BECOME A WINNER (remove your name from the losers file and add it to winners) 😎
5. stage and commit your changes (git add, and git commit) (make your commit message a joke pls)
6. push to remote! (asks you to set upstream, just copy and paste command it gives you)
7. create a pull request with your new branch (on the github repository website)

#### CONGRATS you're ready for your first internship. 😛
